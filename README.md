# Games-success-patterns-identification
Analysis for online store 'Ice' which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. We have data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and we’re planning a campaign for 2017.  The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.
